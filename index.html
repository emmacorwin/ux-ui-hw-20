           <h2> <span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning">OVERVIEW</span></h1>
            <p class="overview"> This design sprint partnered with the Colorado Animal Rescue. My team, with fellow designers, Alika Recek and Madi Mathews, felt compelled to focus our non-profit redesign on the C.A.R. because the current web design is limiting the amount of community engagement in the shelter, and also the potential for the pets of being adopted. Issues like a visibile search bar, detailed and organized pet cards, easy to access resources, navigation buttons where you would expect them to be, the list goes on. Given the abundance of complications we found in their current site design, it was clear that their web presence was not matching their professionalism as a shelter and their passion for the pets.</p>

                    The adoption page provides different sections for the various types of pets. While the adoption page offers further sorting, both the home screen and the adoption page allow for beautiful pet cards, important info on the pets, and navigation to the adoption application form. After completing a simple two page application, the users submit their forms and await contact from the Colorado Animal Rescue.</p>
